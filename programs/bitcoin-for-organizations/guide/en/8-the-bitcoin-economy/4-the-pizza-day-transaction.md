# 8.4 The Pizza Day Transaction

So far, this module has focused on using the open nature of the Bitcoin ledger to compile useful metrics from aggregated transaction data. However, it is possible to use ledger data and block explorers to examine real-world transactions and trace the movement of funds within the network.

Every year on the 22nd of May, the Bitcoin community acknowledges Laszlo Hanyecz, who became the first person reported to use bitcoin to purchase physical goods. On the 18th May 2010, Hanyecz announced on a Bitcointalk.org forum that he was looking for pizza and was willing to pay in BTC. He offered 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to enter into the transaction. He waited for several days, until 19-year-old student Jeremy Sturdivant obliged and sent two large pizzas.

The **Pizza Day** transaction can be viewed by anyone and has the following transaction ID:

`a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d`

Entering this transaction ID into [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) reveals the following:

#### 8.4.1 Activity: Group Discussion

1. Describe the benefits (e.g. auditing, accountability) or risks (e.g. privacy concerns) for individuals or businesses using such a transparent and open transaction system.
1. How might this kind of financial transparency affect industries like charity, government procurement, remittances or law enforcement?
1. Should traditional banking systems offer a similar level of visibility? Will they be forced to by the market?
